\section{Motivation}
Over the past decades football has become the world's most popular sport with over 250 million players in 200 countries. Including over 3 billion fans worldwide, it has also become a multi-million dollar business. One of the main income sources of football clubs are transfers. Huge amounts of money are spent for transfer fees. For football fans the transfer circus is always of big interest, but with approximately 12000 transfers per year it is difficult to keep track of every single transfer. Also, football fans are interested in transfer rumors and statistics. This is the starting point of our project. Basically, the goal of the project is to visualize data concerning football transfers including twitter data, which is interesting for football fans.
